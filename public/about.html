<h1>About Me</h1>
<p><strong>Name: </strong>Mark Takemori<br /></p>
<p><strong>Country: </strong>Japan<br /></p>
<p>
  <strong>Interests: </strong>I'm very interested in <em>Buddhism</em>,
  <em>Psychology</em>, <em>the Japanese language</em> and many other things.<br />
  I have a strong passion for teaching, which is what really pushes me towards
  learning new things. Whenever I am in a situation where someone has a question
  that is not being answered, my heart goes out to them, as I remember my youth
  full of questions but no where to turn to.<br />
  For this reason it is my life long passion to keep learning, so I may help
  others in their time of need.<br />
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Aspirations: </strong>I aspire to be able to create websites and
  movile apps related to my interests. Specifically, I am aiming towards
  creating accessible websites for people interested in <em>real life</em> in
  Japan, as well as those interested in learning the realities of how to
  mentally set themselves up to thrive here.
